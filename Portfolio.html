            Hey! My name is Mark Linkletter and I am a graphic designer from Westchester, New York. I am primarily interested in illustration and have a strong background in print media. My latest work however deals more with using my illustrative skills towards logo designs and simple animations. I have recently graduated from The State University of New York at Oswego and received a Bachelor of Fine Arts. I am 22 years old and currently employed as a Graphic Design Associate for David Monn LLC. In the future I hope to learn web design well enough to pursue a career in it, or at least add it to my graphic design skillset.
